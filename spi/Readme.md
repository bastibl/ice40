# SPI Flash Reader

This module is designed for the iCEstick. It reads data from the flash (starting at 1M) and sends it through UART.

The UART transmitter is from the excellent FPGA tutorials at: https://github.com/Obijuan/open-fpga-verilog-tutorial/wiki

The SPI reader is from Sylvain Munaut: https://github.com/smunaut/ice40-playground
